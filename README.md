# Dart-Project


The lecture **Data-Integrated Simulation Science A** is devided into four parts. This project was created in relation to the 2nd part from Syn Schmitt called **Active motion generation using neuro-musculo-skeletal models**

## Project

This project aims at simulating a person throwing a Dart at an primitive Dart board. Following simplification have been made:

* Neglecting air friction
* Simple Model of a Dart
* ...

## Topic of the lecture

* Model of high-level motor control
* Model of low-level motor control
* Model of skeletal muscle
* Model of skeletal structure
